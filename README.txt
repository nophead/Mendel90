Limitations
-----------
Currently only supports mendel and sturdy machine variants, the huxley version needs more work.

Use
---
To make all the files for a machine run
    make_machine.py machine_name

To make just the bom, sheets or stls run bom.py, sheets.py or stls.py machine_name.

machine_name can be mendel or sturdy. To make your own variant copy scad\conf\mendel_config.scad or scad\conf\sturdy_config.scad to yourname_config.scad.  Then run make_machine yourname.

To view the model of the whole machine, open scad\main.scad. It will take several minutes to render (about about 8 miniutes on my computer) but after that you can pan and zoom it at reasonable speed
and changes takes less time to render.  (Note: main.scad will only render correctly if conf\machine.scad exists, which is created by the make_machine.py script.)

To view a sub-assembly, open the individual scad files. Set the exploded flag in config.scad to make exploded views.
